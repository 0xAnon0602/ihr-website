It aims to provide network operators, policymakers, and other stakeholders, with a better understanding of the Internet's infrastructure and its evolution. Network data is obtained from public large-scale measurement platform, such as RIPE Atlas, RIS, and Routeviews. This data is analyzed with a set of tools pinpointing delay changes, forwarding anomalies, network disconnections and routing changes.  In a general effort towards transparency and reusability, the Internet Health Report data and analysis tools are made publicly available.",

A value close to 1 means that the reachability of the monitored AS is strongly depending on that transit AS. In the above example, the plot shows only few weak dependencies to Telia (AS1299), NTT America (AS2914), Level(3) (AS3356), and GTT (AS3257).
