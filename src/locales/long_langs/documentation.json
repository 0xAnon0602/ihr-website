Networks observed in the builtin and anchoring measurements are likely to appear in the delay change and forwarding anomaly reports. And networks hosting more than 10 public probes appear in the network disconnection reports. The best way to ensure that your network is monitored is to host an anchor (delay changes, forwarding anomalies) and at least 10 probes (network disconnection). <br><br>For <b>routing changes</b>, we use BGP data to monitor Internet routing infrastructure. If your AS is publicly advertising IP space then it should be already monitored by our system."

For the <a href='/ihr/2497/asn/?date=2018-02-15&last=7'>second week of January 2018 we obtain the two following plots</a>:</p> <img src='/static/ihr/hegemony_AS2497.png' style='max-width:100%'> <p><b>The top plot</b> shows the AS dependencies of AS2497. That means the most common transit networks used to reach AS2497. The value (a.k.a AS hegemony) range between 0 and 1. The value represents the ratio of AS paths towards AS2497 that contain a certain AS transit.  Values close to 1 mean that the reachability of the monitored AS is strongly depending on a transit AS. The plot shows only three weak dependencies to Level(3) (AS3356), NTT America (AS2914), and GTT (AS3257). Around mid-February, 14% of the paths towards IIJ transit through Level(3), 12% through NTT, and 3% through GTT. Stub ASes usually have much higher values, for example the values goes up to 1 for  ASes with a single upstream provider (meaning that all the paths include the upstream provider). You can click on the graph to display dependencies details at particular timestamp and a graphical representation of BGP changes around that time (<a href='https://labs.ripe.net/Members/vastur/bgplay-v2-integrated-in-ripestat' target='_blank'>using BGPlay</a>).</p> <p><b>The bottom plot</b> shows the number of networks that depend on AS2497. In this case there is about 400 networks that use IIJ for transit. This is somehow related to <a href='http://as-rank.caida.org/asns/2497' target='_blank'>IIJ's customer cone</a>. The main difference is that networks using IIJ as a backup transit are not counted here whereas they are counted in its customer cone.
