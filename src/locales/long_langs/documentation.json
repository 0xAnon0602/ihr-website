For the <a href='/ihr/2497/asn/?date=2018-02-15&last=7'>second week of January 2018 we obtain the two following plots</a>:</p> <img src='/static/ihr/hegemony_AS2497.png' style='max-width:100%'> <p><b>The top plot</b> shows the AS dependencies of AS2497. That means the most common transit networks used to reach AS2497. The value (a.k.a AS hegemony) range between 0 and 1. The value represents the ratio of AS paths towards AS2497 that contain a certain AS transit.  Values close to 1 mean that the reachability of the monitored AS is strongly depending on a transit AS. The plot shows only three weak dependencies to Level(3) (AS3356), NTT America (AS2914), and GTT (AS3257). Around mid-February, 14% of the paths towards IIJ transit through Level(3), 12% through NTT, and 3% through GTT. Stub ASes usually have much higher values, for example the values goes up to 1 for  ASes with a single upstream provider (meaning that all the paths include the upstream provider). You can click on the graph to display dependencies details at particular timestamp and a graphical representation of BGP changes around that time (<a href='https://labs.ripe.net/Members/vastur/bgplay-v2-integrated-in-ripestat' target='_blank'>using BGPlay</a>).</p> <p><b>The bottom plot</b> shows the number of networks that depend on AS2497. In this case there is about 400 networks that use IIJ for transit. This is somehow related to <a href='http://as-rank.caida.org/asns/2497' target='_blank'>IIJ's customer cone</a>. The main difference is that networks using IIJ as a backup transit are not counted here whereas they are counted in its customer cone.
